## Components

The project consists of the following components:

- Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment used for executing server-side code.
- Express.js: A web application framework for Node.js used to handle routing and middleware.
- MySQL: A relational database management system used to store user and blog data.

## Database Schema

The database schema consists of two tables:

### User Table:

- `id` (integer, primary key): The unique identifier for each user.
- `profilepic` (string): The path or URL to the user's profile picture.
